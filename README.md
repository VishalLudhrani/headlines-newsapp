# Headlines - News on the go

A news app which helps busy professionals keep updated with just headlines.

## The problem

The news apps that provide news briefs consume huge amount of mobile data when you’re travelling to work, or travelling in general.

Moreover, when we attend someone while reading an article, or when it’s our station, we leave that article in our read later list, and it goes dead.

## The solution

The solution to that is, eliminating the habit of reading articles on the go. No articles, no temptation to read further, no time wasted.

This app distinctively focuses on news delivered with headlines.
